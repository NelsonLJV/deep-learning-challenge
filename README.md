Module 21 Challenge


Objective: 
Our goal to achieve in this analysis is to use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classsifier. Our dataset containg information of over 34,000 organizations that have been funded in some wway by Alphabet Soup. 


Summary:

Model Overview: Our analysis employed a deep learning model to predict whether a company funding is succesful. Between all the models we used to test this, our hioghest accuracy was only able to git 72%. Perhaps the use of other models could land us better results. A potetntial alternative could be to use the Perceptron model which emulates a biological neuron, processing input data, assigning weights to information, and producing a definitive output.




Conclusion: 

While our deep learning model gave promising results, we alwasy have room for improvement when it comes to reaching an accuracy levelhigher than 75%. The use of a model such as the Perceptron model could help us reach this goal
